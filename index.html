		<h3>Full stack web developer in training</h2>
		<img class="photo" src="portfolioImages/nelly.jpg">
		<p>Having trained at Newcastle University for 4 years I qualified in 2018 as a Speech and Language Therapist. I have worked for the NHS for 5 years in various different fields (children's therapy services, public health, administration). I decided to apply for the Mayden Academy to train as a full stack software developer. I could see from my previous experience many areas that could be facilitated by technical solutions in the world of health care and the NHS, as well as some personal projects I would like to put into fruition!</p>
		<p>Alongside my work, I have a keen interest in travel and speaking modern foreign languages, cooking, and yoga!</p>
